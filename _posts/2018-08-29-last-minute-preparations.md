LatinR is just a few days from now and we are in the final preparations. We ask you, then, that you read carefully this information:

#### Before LatinR

* We remind you that LatinR adheres to this [code of conduct](http://latin-r.com/coc/).

* We will use [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/latin-r/shared_invite/enQtNDA3MjM3MTQwOTM1LTRiZGM2Mjc0ZDU2YzE5OTBmYWRhNDRiYzMzY2M1MDk3MzNjOTUzZTdlZWMyZmJiZjYzMWE4Y2VkNTk0MWFmNDA) to keep in touch. If haven't yet, we suggest you to join. It is a great space to resolve any issues about travel if you are coming to Buenos Aires. We will also be organising social activities there. To learn more about what Slack is and how it's used we recommend [this link](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-).

* During the conference we will be tweeting from [@LatinR2018](https://twitter.com/LatinR2018) with hashtag [#LatinR2018](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23latinr2018).

* Photos of the event will be published in different media and social networks. If you would prefer your pictures to not be published, please let us know **before the event** so we can inform the photographers. 

* On September 5th between 9 am and 1 pm there will be two simultaneous tracks, one for oral presentations and the other for a The Carpentries workshop. The latter will be in Spanish and has limited capacity and you can register [here](https://ti.to/carpentries/LatinR). It is an excellent opportunity to get to know about this community, it's instructors program and improve your teaching skills. 

#### During LatinR

* Accreditation will start at 9 am on Monday September 3rd. Please **take care of your credential** since it is the only way to access the activities.

* We recommend taking care of your personal belongings since we can't be held responsible for loss, damaged or stolen property. 

* The organising team will have a pin with the LatinR logo so you can identify us easily. 


Thank you so much for being part of this first version of LatinR!
