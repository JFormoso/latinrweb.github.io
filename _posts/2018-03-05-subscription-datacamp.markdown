The first works sent and accepted to LatinR will recieve, at the moment of registrarion, a free month subscription to [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), the leading platform for online learning for languages like R and Python.

One of the most remarkable features of DataCamp is that, in addition to being able to complete isolated courses, it is possible to follow tracks with professional orientation (Data Scientist, Data Analyst, among others) or with skill orientation (for example, Data Visualization, Machine Learning , Time Series, etc.).

Thanks to the fact that there are courses for both beginners and more advanced users, this benefit delivered by our sponsor will allow LatinR participants to continue developing their knowledge once the conference is over.
