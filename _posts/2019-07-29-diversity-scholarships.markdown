#### Diversity Scholarships LatinR2019

Thanks to the support of our sponsors, in this edition of LatinR we will be able to offer assistance scholarships that seek to encourage the participation of less represented groups. Scholarships include:

- the conference ticket for the 26th and 27th of September
- registration for two of the tutorials on Wednesday 25 September
- depending on the case, an economic contribution of between 200 and 400 USD for transportation and/or accommodation for those coming from outside Santiago. We know that in many cases this amount is not enough to cover the entire trip, but it can help cushion the expense.

The application is made through this link: [bit.ly/becas-latinr2019](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczga2O9z9isnf4HN4ZlzCbTFfdvqtZ0Dsk0I5Sor3w6wyP2Q/viewform). The form will be open until Monday, August 5 at 3:00 p.m., Chilean Continental Time (UTC - 4:00 a.m.). The results will be published on Monday 12 August. 

Scholarship recipients will receive an electronic transfer once the event is over. It will be necessary to provide proof of travel (ticket, accommodation, etc.) in order to make the reimbursement.

Scholarships will be allocated considering criteria of need, diversity and possibility of impact.
