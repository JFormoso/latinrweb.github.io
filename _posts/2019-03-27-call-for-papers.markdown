###### Round tables

Round tables bring together researchers and professionals to present different viewpoints about a common topic. Proposals must consider one moderator and between 3 and 4 presenters.

The format will be as follows. First, a five minute introductory presentation by the moderator. Since LatinR gathers people from a great variety of disciplines, this introduction is meant to familiarise the audience with the particular topic of the round table. It should also explicitly state the connection of each presenter to the topic. Then, each presenter will have a maximum of 15 minutes. At the end, there will be 15 minutes for Q&A with the audience.

We are particularly interested in lineups that include presenters from diverse backgrounds (different institutions, countries, areas of research, gender, etc...) and show different methodologies and approaches to the subject.
